Calx is an idiomatic wrapper for OpenCL, which is an abstraction layer for parallel computation.  Using a C-variant language, a programmer can target CPUs, GPUs, and more exotic hardware (the Cell processor used in the PS3, for instance).

The OpenCL API is not known for its terseness; consider this "'Hello World' example":http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/samplecode/OpenCL_Hello_World_Example/Listings/hello_c.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40008187-hello_c-DontLinkElementID_4 example demonstrating the necessary steps to square a list of floating point numbers.  Using Calx, the same result can be achieved like so:

<pre><code>(use '[calx core data])	
	
(def source
  "__kernel void square (
       __global float *a) {
    int gid = get_global_id(0);
    a[gid] = a[gid] * a[gid];
  }")

(with-cl
  (with-program (compile-program source)
    (let [a (wrap [1 2 3] :float))]
      (enqueue-kernel :square 3 a)
      (enqueue-read c))))
</code></pre>
	    
This is very much a work in progress, but still can be immediately useful for some purposes.  Anyone using it is encouraged to give feedback.
